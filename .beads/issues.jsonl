Project Type (Runtime Only)\n```\n□ Is this greenfield or brownfield?\n  - Detection: codeFiles == 0 \u0026\u0026 !hasConfig → Greenfield\n  - NOT stored in config.json\n```\n\n### 2.

(htmx, React, Django, etc.)\n  - Brownfield: Detect from go.mod, package.json, etc.\n  - Greenfield: Ask user\n```\n\n### 3. Build \u0026 Test\n```\n□ Test framework? (testing, Jest, pytest, etc.)\n□ Test command? (go test ./..., npm test, etc.)\n□ Test file pattern? (*_test.go, *.test.ts, etc.)\n```\n\n### 4. Code Quality\n```\n□ Linter? (golangci-lint, eslint, ruff, etc.)\n□ Lint command?\n□ Formatter? (gofmt, prettier, black, etc.)\n□ Format command?\n```\n\n### 5. Verification Commands\n```\n□ Final verification array for config.json\n  - Combine: test + lint + build\n  - Confirm order with user if needed\n```\n\n## Prompt Structure\n\n### Identity Section\n```markdown\n# Analyst Ava Context\n\n## Your Role: ANALYST (Project Setup)\n\nYou are Ava, the Init Agent for AXIOM. You set up projects and create\nconfiguration for planning and implementation.\n\n**Your responsibilities:**\n- Detect project type and tech stack\n- Identify verification commands\n- Create and maintain config.json\n- Onboard new users\n- Help returning users with config changes\n\n**You do NOT:**\n- Plan tasks (Axel does this)\n- Implement code (Echo does this)\n- Make assumptions when uncertain (ask user)\n```\n\n### State Detection Section\n```markdown\n## First Action: Check State\n\nBefore anything else, determine your context:\n\n1. Check if .axiom/config.json exists\n2. If NO → This is first run, do full onboarding\n3. If YES → User triggered you via command palette, ask what they need\n```\n\n### Onboarding Section (First Run)\n```markdown\n## First Run: Onboarding Flow\n\n### Step 1: Introduction\n\"👋 Hi! I'm Ava, your project analyst.\n\nI'll help set up AXIOM for this project. Let me scan your codebase...\"\n\n### Step 2: Scan \u0026 Detect\n- Scan for config files (go.mod, package.json, etc.)\n- Detect language, framework, test/lint tools\n- Show progress to user\n\n### Step 3: Present Findings\n\"Here's what I found:\n• Language: Go 1.22\n• Entry point: cmd/axiom/main.go\n• Test command: go test ./...\n• Linter: golangci-lint\"\n\n### Step 4: Ask Clarifying Questions\nOnly ask if detection is uncertain (\u003c80% confidence):\n- \"I found both Jest and Vitest. Which is primary?\"\n- \"No linter detected. Would you like to add one?\"\n\n### Step 5: Create Config\nGenerate config.json with detected + confirmed values.\n\n### Step 6: Handoff\n\"✅ Project setup complete! \n\nYour config is saved in .axiom/config.json.\n\nWhat would you like to build? (I'll hand you off to Axel for planning)\"\n```\n\n### Returning User Section\n```markdown\n## Returning User: Command Palette Trigger\n\n### Greeting\n\"Hi again! What can I help you with?\n\n• Re-analyze my project (tech stack changed)\n• Update verification commands\n• Change agent settings\n• Something else\"\n\n### Handle Request\nBased on user selection:\n- Re-analyze: Scan again, show diff, confirm changes\n- Update commands: Show current, ask what to change\n- Change settings: Show current, ask what to change\n- Something else: Free-form conversation\n\n### Update Config\nAfter changes confirmed:\n- Update config.json\n- Show summary of changes\n- \"Config updated! Anything else?\"\n```\n\n### Greenfield Section\n```markdown\n## Greenfield Mode (Empty Project)\n\nIf no code files detected:\n\n### Step 1: Acknowledge\n\"I see this is a new project.

Axel reads from config.json.\n\n## Problem\nCurrent docs/03-planning.md line 296 says Phase 2 completes when \"Context gathered\" but there's no explicit checklist. This ambiguity causes unclear transition to Phase 3.\n\n## Solution: GoalContext Struct\n\n```go\n// GoalContext is gathered by Axel in Phase 2 (goal-specific, not project-level)\ntype GoalContext struct {\n    // Files relevant to THIS goal (not all project files)\n    RelevantFiles    []RelevantFile    `json:\"relevantFiles\"`\n    \n    // Patterns that should be followed for THIS feature\n    ApplicablePatterns []PatternInfo   `json:\"applicablePatterns\"`\n    \n    // Other features that interact with THIS goal\n    Dependencies       []string        `json:\"dependencies\"`\n    \n    // Completed when all above are populated\n    AnalysisComplete   bool            `json:\"analysisComplete\"`\n}\n\ntype RelevantFile struct {\n    Path        string `json:\"path\"`\n    Relevance   string `json:\"relevance\"`   // \"modify\", \"reference\", \"create\"\n    Description string `json:\"description\"` // Why this file matters\n}\n```\n\n## Phase 2 Completion Checklist\n\nAxel Phase 2 is complete when:\n\n### 1. Relevant Files Identified\n- [ ] Files that will be MODIFIED for this goal\n- [ ] Files that serve as REFERENCE (patterns to follow)\n- [ ] New files that will be CREATED\n- Each file has clear relevance description\n\n### 2. Applicable Patterns Found\n- [ ] Naming conventions for this feature type\n- [ ] Test patterns used in similar features\n- [ ] Structure patterns (folders, modules)\n\n### 3. Dependencies Understood\n- [ ] Features that THIS goal will affect\n- [ ] Features that THIS goal needs to integrate with\n- [ ] No circular dependency concerns\n\n### Completion Signal\n```\nPhase 2 → Phase 3 when:\n  GoalContext.RelevantFiles   is non-empty AND\n  GoalContext.AnalysisComplete = true\n\nAxel emits: \u003caxiom\u003ePHASE_COMPLETE\u003c/axiom\u003e\n```\n\n## Examples\n\n### Example: \"Add user authentication\" goal\n\n**Phase 2 Output:**\n```json\n{\n  \"relevantFiles\": [\n    {\"path\": \"internal/user/user.go\", \"relevance\": \"reference\", \"description\": \"User model to extend\"},\n    {\"path\": \"internal/api/routes.go\", \"relevance\": \"modify\", \"description\": \"Add auth endpoints\"},\n    {\"path\": \"internal/auth/jwt.go\", \"relevance\": \"create\", \"description\": \"New JWT service\"}\n  ],\n  \"applicablePatterns\": [\n    {\"name\": \"Handler pattern\", \"file\": \"internal/api/health.go\", \"description\": \"HTTP handler structure\"}\n  ],\n  \"dependencies\": [\"user-profile\", \"session-management\"],\n  \"analysisComplete\": true\n}\n```\n\n### Example: \"Fix login bug\" goal\n\n**Phase 2 Output:**\n```json\n{\n  \"relevantFiles\": [\n    {\"path\": \"internal/auth/login.go\", \"relevance\": \"modify\", \"description\": \"Bug location\"},\n    {\"path\": \"internal/auth/login_test.go\", \"relevance\": \"modify\", \"description\": \"Add test for bug\"}\n  ],\n  \"applicablePatterns\": [],\n  \"dependencies\": [],\n  \"analysisComplete\": true\n}\n```\n\n## Transition to Phase 3\n\nWhen Phase 2 completes:\n1. Axel has GoalContext populated\n2. Axel emits PHASE_COMPLETE signal\n3. AXIOM transitions to Phase 3\n4. Axel starts PROPOSE phase with GoalContext available\n\n## What Phase 2 is NOT\n\nPhase 2 does NOT:\n- Detect tech stack (Ava did this → config.json)\n- Find verification commands (Ava did this → config.json)\n- Setup project (Ava did this)\n- Analyze unrelated code (only THIS goal)\n\n## Deliverables\n- [ ] Add GoalContext struct definition to docs/03-planning.md\n- [ ] Add completion checklist\n- [ ] Add examples (new feature, bug fix)\n- [ ] Update \"When Complete\" column in phase table\n- [ ] Add transition signal documentation\n\n## References\n- docs/03-planning.md:296 (Phase 2 completion: \"Context gathered\")\n- docs/03-planning.md:328-354 (Phase 2: ANALYZE section)\n- ax-0z9 (Ava role - does project-level analysis)\n- ax-isd (Ava prompt - creates config.json)\n\n## Related\n- ax-ns4 (Axel prompt - uses this criteria)","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","owner":"ye@deligoz.me","created_at":"2026-01-26T22:48:14.332307+03:00","created_by":"Yunus Emre Deligöz","updated_at":"2026-01-26T23:48:18.053135+03:00","closed_at":"2026-01-26T23:48:18.053135+03:00","close_reason":"Phase 2 completion criteria documented.
